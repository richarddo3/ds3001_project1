        "NHANES is a rich panel dataset on health and behavior, collected bi-yearly from around 1999 to now. We will focus on the 1999 wave, because that has the largest follow-up window, providing us with the richest mortality data. The mortality data is provided by the CDC Linked Mortality File.\n",

        "\n",
        "First, go to the NHANES and LMF web sites and familiarize yourself with the data sources. Download codebooks. Think about what resources are available. The CDC Linked Mortality File is somewhat of a pain to work with, so I have pre-cleaned it for you. It is available at httts://github.com/ds4e/undergraduate_ml_assignments in the data folder, as `lmf_parsed.cav`. From the CDC LMF web page, get the SAS program to load the data; it is the real codebook.\n",

        "Second, the goal of the project is to use whatever demographic, behavioral, and health data you like to predict mortality (`MORTSTAT`) and life expectancy (`PERMTH_INT`). Go to the NHANES 1999--2000 web page and select your data and download it. Clearly explain your rationale for selecting these data. Use `.merge` to combine your data into one complete dataframe. Document missing values. (5/100 pts)\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, do basic EDA and visualization of the key variables. Are any important variables skewed? Are there outliers? How correlated are pairs of variables? Do pairs of categorical variables exhibit interesting patterns in contingency tables? Provide a clear discussion and examination of the data and the variables you are interested in using.

        "2. Describe the variables you selected to predict mortality and life expectancy, and the rationale behind them. Analyze your variables using describe tables, kernel densities, scatter plots, and conditional kernel densities. Are there any patterns of interest to notice? (10/100 pts)\n",
        "3. Using your variables to predict mortality using a $k$-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Analyze its performance and explain clearly how you select $k$. (10/100 pts)\n",

        "### Data Merging Procedure\n",
        "\n",
        "All NHANES datasets contain a unique respondent identifier variable, **SEQN**.  \n",
        "This variable was used as the merge key to combine files.\n",
        "\n",
        "The datasets were merged using an inner join:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Demographic file (DEMO.xpt)\n",
        "- Linked Mortality File (linked_mortality_file_1999_2000.csv)\n",
        "\n",
        "The merge ensured that each observation corresponds to a single participant with both baseline demographic data and mortality follow-up information.\n",
        "\n",
        "After merging, the resulting dataframe contains 151 variables and 9,965 total observations before filtering.\n",

        "### Handling Linkage Eligibility\n",
        "\n",
        "Because mortality status is only defined for linkage-eligible individuals, we restricted the dataset to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `ELIGSTAT == 1` (eligible for linkage)\n",
        "- Non-missing `MORTSTAT` values\n",
        "\n",
        "This resulted in:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **5,445 eligible participants**\n",
        "- 1,675 deceased (30.76%)\n",
        "- 3,770 alive (69.24%)\n",
        "\n",
        "This restriction ensures that mortality outcomes are valid and interpretable.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Documentation of Missing Values\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing values are present in several variables for the following reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Participants under age 18 are coded as ineligible (ELIGSTAT = 2), resulting in missing mortality outcomes.\n",
        "2. Some health and behavioral variables contain item nonresponse.\n",
        "3. Follow-up time variables are missing for linkage-ineligible participants.\n",
        "\n",
        "After filtering to eligible individuals, mortality status contains no missing values.  \n",
        "Other predictor variables were evaluated for missingness using summary statistics and will be handled appropriately (e.g., removal, imputation, or encoding) prior to model fitting.\n",

        "The final analytical dataset combines demographic and mortality follow-up data using SEQN as the merge key. The selected variables were chosen based on epidemiological relevance to mortality risk, ensuring theoretical justification for predictive modeling."
